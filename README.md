# Graduate Network Conversation Analysis

Problem:  The United States Military Academy's Association of Graduates has been performing a reach out to 43,000 living graduates.  During these calls they have been collecting data.  Unfortunately, they have no one to analyze this data for trends and patterns.

**Objective** Create a variety of success metrics for graduate conversation and best practices.  Additionally, provide some descriptive statistics for the association.

**Risks** As of today, I still do not have access to the data.  I need one more person to sign off then it is off to the races.  In the meantime, I prepping a back up project to avoid disaster.
